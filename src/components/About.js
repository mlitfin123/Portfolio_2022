                        <p>
                            I am a professional web developer and software engineer with a passion for learning and trying new things. My training includes a certificate in full-stack web development from the University of Miami in addition to a bachelors degree from a four year university. I am constantly working on new projects in my spare time which has helped me to continuously develop new skills. I am known for my attention to detail and persistence when it comes to problem solving which I have been able to develop through my years of working in quality assurance. When Iâ€™m not coding you might find me busy training for a bodybuilding or powerlifting meet or enjoying the nice Florida weather.
